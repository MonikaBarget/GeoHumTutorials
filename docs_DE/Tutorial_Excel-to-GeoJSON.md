This script transform an EXCEL spreadsheet that contains geocoded spatial information (coordinates) into a GeoJSON file. This file format is compatible with most standard GIS software including QGIS. A GeoJSON file can thus be used to create a static or interactive map.

This script, too, will display sample data on an interactive map. The code was provided in a Google Colab so that users without coding experience or local installations of Python can also execute it on their own machines.
