<h2>Geocoding with the Geonames API in Python</h2>

<h3>Working with Google Colab, Geocoder for Python, and the Geonames API</h3>

<p align="justify">This tutorial combines actual executable code with explanations in a <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/">Google Colab</a> notebook. The advantage of Google Colab is that you can run the script as it is -- without installing Python and individual packages on your machine. General instructions for using Colab are available <a href="LINK">here</a>. As the code requires a Geonames API key, please consider signing up on the <a href="http://www.geonames.org/login">Geonames website</a> first.</p>

<p align="justify">API stands for "application programming interface". It is essentially a web "gateway" that you can use to access data or services. Each user ideally has their own unique API key. APIs come with legal obligations and, in many cases, request limits. That means that each API holder can only perform a fixed amount of queries per day to guarantee good performance for all users and to hinder illegal activities. In my scripts shared here, the API key has to be added where you now see a string of hashtags ("#####").</p>

<p>GeoNames as a geodata service is mainly using REST APIs and offers 40 different webservices. Geocoder for Python, which is used in the code shared here, supports the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>(geocoding) retrieve GeoNamesâ€™s geocoded data from a query string, and various filters</li>
    <li>(details) retrieve all geonames data for a given geonames_id</li>
    <li>(children) retrieve the hierarchy of a given geonames_id</li>
    <li>(hierarchy) retrieve all children for a given geonames_id</li>
 </ul>

<h3>Geocoding data and plotting a static map</h3>

<p align="justify">My first script making use of Python Geocoder and the Geonames API <a href="https://github.com/MonikaBarget/GeoHumTutorials/blob/master/Colab_Geocoding/Geocode_Plot_Geonames.ipynb">geocodes placenames from a table and plots a static map</a>. This Python code is provided in Jupyter Notebook format with in-line comments for execution in Google Colab (also check the Colab Geocoding directory for more examples). Running this code should first show you the content of the input file, which only has a single column of twelve place names in my own sample. Then the code should geocode your address column with Geonames, add the Geonames ids and official Geonames place descriptions, and append all the new information to the existing table. In the last step, all places which could be geocoded will be plotted as small dots on a simple world map:</p>

<h3>Geocoding data and plotting an interactive map</h3>

<p align="justify">As static maps aren't the ideal display to check the geocoding
of individual point geometries (e.g. cities), I have provided <a href="./Colab_Geocoding/Geocode_Plot_Geonames_interactiveMAP.ipynb">another script that plots the geocoded data to an interactive map.</a> This map is generated with the <bold>ipyleaflet</bold> package for Python and permits different ZOOM level. In the ipyleaflet settings in the code, the base map and colours used for markers can be adjusted.</p>

<h3>Generating a GeoJSON file for working with GIS tools</h3>

<p algin="justify">Both Geonames geocoding scripts shared here also generate a <a href="https://geojson.org/">GeoJSON file</a> from your input data. Geoinformation in this standardised format can be analysed and visualised in a wide range of GIS software, including <a href="https://qgis.org/en/site/">QGIS</a>. If you want to learn how to create and print simple maps in QGIS, please check out my <a href="https://monikabarget.github.io/GeoHumTutorials/Tutorial_simpleQGISmaps">QGIS tutorial for beginners</a>. While it is possible to directly geocode data with GIS software, capturing additional information such as Geonames (and Wikidata) IDs, normalised place names, modern postal codes or place types can be important for making data interoperable and reusable. Working with spatial APIs via Python offers many opportunities for enriching the collected data.</p>
