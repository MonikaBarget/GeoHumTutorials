<h3>Overview of commonly used geodata packages for Python<h3>

<p>In an article from July 2023, Neha Sharma has described a total of 70 Python packages that can be used for the collection, analysis and visualisation of geospatial data:
<a href="https://medium.com/@ns_geoai/70-geospatial-python-libraries-54604d815a7b">70 Geospatial Python Libraries</a>
The list ranges from geodata APIs to general data analysis tools, interface builders and bespoke mapping tools. Not all of the packages are equally suitable for geohumanities applications and especially working with historical spatial data.
This is why the GeoHumTutorials repository aims to provide more specific examples for humanities students and scholars.</p>

- <a href="https://python-visualization.github.io/folium/latest/">Folium</a> (see tutorial by <a href="https://python.plainenglish.io/crafting-compelling-interactive-visualizations-with-python-and-folium-99a95d41219b">Godwin Murithi</p>)
<p>Folium is a Python wrapper for Leaflet.js, which is a popular JavaScript library for interactive maps. This pakcage permits the combination of several layers. 
  Folium provides a FeatureGroup class to group several layers together so that they can be displayed and edited as a single entity. Geoinformation from dataframes is read to lists. </p>

- <a href="https://dash.plotly.com/tutorial">Dash</a> (see <a href="https://pub.aimind.so/geospatial-visualizations-with-dash-and-folium-a36a9face91d">tutorial for geospatial visualizations with Dash and Folium</a> by Osvaldo Yanez)
<p>Dash is an app-building package that can also be used for the deployment of maps.</p>
