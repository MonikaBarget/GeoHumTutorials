<h2>Google Colab tutorial for geocoding EXCEL spreadsheets with OpenCage in Python</h2>

<p align="justify">This Google Colab tutorial was written for a workshop for colleagues in early modern history and demonstrates geocoding with the proprietary OpenCage API.
Input data, the annotated code and a sample map can be viewed in my <a href="https://github.com/MonikaBarget/GeoHumTutorials/tree/master/Colab_Geocoding">
Colab_Geocoding</a> directory.</p>

<p>Access to the <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1TtMkbA2LFkC0Nuvsq0dZzQqGJIx1xQ7u">actual Colab notebook</a> is restricted is the script makes use of my personal API key.</p>
