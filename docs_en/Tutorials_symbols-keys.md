<h2>Symbols and keys in the history of cartography</h2>

<p>Cartographic symbols were first formalised in the early modern period and printed maps produced since the early 17th century generally came with keys that explained the use of more unusual symbology or letters and numbers used. While we are still familiar with some of the early modern cartographic symbols today, others are no longer used.</p>

<p>Carefully studying surviving map keys from the early modern period can, therefore, give us a sense of how map-makers of the period structured space and assigned hierarchies to individual places. One detailed early modern map key accompanies the hand-coloured copperplate map <em>Quangsi, Sinarum Imperii Provincia Decimatertia</em> (Quangsi, the 13th Province of the Chinese Empire) from Martino Martini’s 1655 <em>Novus atlas Sinensis</em> (New Atlas of China) (<strong>fig. 1</strong>):</p>

Here we see, for instance, that inhabited places are differentiated by size and importance. Similar keys, with slightly different attributions, were used in a late seventeenth-century copy of the so-called English <em>Anonymous</em> map originally produced in 1603. The key of this map explains the symbolism in both Latin and English (see close-up on the <a href="https://www.revolutionaryplayers.org.uk/keys-and-explanations/" target="_blank">Revolutionary Players website</a>).
